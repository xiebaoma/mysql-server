    Current implementation does not crash in case of lock_sys_resize() executed
    concurrently with iterating over locks, instead returning incomplete data.
    This is better than reporting some locks twice, which would violate primary
    key constraint, and could happen if we blindly report all locks from
    m_bucket_id-th cell, without first checking if hash table was resized
    causing reshuffling of entries among cells.
    For now, the only use of this iterator is in performance_schema.data_locks
    and performance_schema.data_wait_locks which both provide no guarantee that
    the view of the locks is consistent. I consider current implementation a
    good trade-off between simplicity of implementation and correctness, as any
    problems can only occur during dynamically resizing the buffer pool (which
    causes resize of lock-sys hash tables) and the only manifestation will be
    that some locks are not reported (which is always possible anyway given
    that we don't hold any latch permanently).
    A more complicated solution would be to have a dedicated rwlock x-acquired
    for lock_sys_resize() and s-acquired by the iterator constructor and
    released in the destructor.
    Having long-lasting latches, and non-trivial life-cycle of this class seems
    to be introducing too much complexity to me (for one thing, reasoning about
    latching order is very complicated then).

  /* A thread which is dropping the table is not expecting the n_ref_count
  to be above 0 (or 1 if we count the thread itself), because it holds exclusive
  MDL on the table, and so nobody else should be accessing it. Yet, this method
  here will call dd_table_open_on_id_in_mem(..) which is incrementing
  n_ref_count. However, before releasing dict_sys->mutex it will decrement
  n_ref_count again by calling table->release(), so the dropping thread should
  not observe the state with elevated n_ref_count, because it checks it while
  holding the dict_sys->mutex. Because visitor might be quite heavy, we do so,
  before calling visitor. This, however, means visitor is called without holding
  dict_sys->mutex nor even n_ref_count protection, thus it is crucial, that we
  ensure table is not freed by other means: namely we verified that there is at
  least one lock in table->locks, and we keep the shard mutex which prevents
  anyone from releasing it - this is sufficient, and a technique already used in
  other parts of the lock_sys, because one can not free a dict_table_t unless
  all locks are released first. One drawback of this approach is that we acquire
  lock_sys shard mutex, while holding dict_sys->mutex. To minimize the impact of
  doing so, we only do so if table->locks appears non-empty - which we can check
  without any mutex because it is an atomic. Of course, because we don't hold
  any mutex, there's nothing preventing anyone from adding or removing locks on
  this table, but this is fine, as we do not promise at which exact moment
  during the call table->locks are inspected, so we can pick a convenient
  linearization moment, or even check it twice, and the caller can't complain.
  There are important reasons we use table->release() instead of a more regular
  dict_table_close or dd_table_close:
     - The dict_table_close, as a side effect might call dict_stats_deinit()
       when the n_ref_count drops to zero, which could interfere with
       create_table_info_t::create_table_update_dict() which is calling
       dict_stats_update() without properly bumping the n_ref_count.
       In worst case, our thread could deinitialize the stats just before
       dict_stats_save() is called from dict_stats_update() to persist them.
     - The dict_table_close() calls table->lock() which would violate latching
       order if done while holding lock sys shard mutex.
     - It's a bit cheaper and we try to not hog dict_sys->mutex */
