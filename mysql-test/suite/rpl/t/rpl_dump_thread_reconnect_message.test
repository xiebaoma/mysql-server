# ==== Purpose ====
# Verify that a clear and meaningful message is logged on the source when
# restarting the IO thread.
#
# ==== Requirements ====
# A clear and meaningful message must be logged in the source log file during
# the IO thread restart.
#
# ==== Implementation ====
#  1. Set up initial source-replica configuration
#  2. Start IO thread on replica which will start a dump thread on source
#  3. Restart the IO thread (Source should kill existing dump thread before
#     starting a new dump thread)
#  4. Verify that no message appears stating 'killed the zombie thread'
#  5. Verify that a message stating 'killed the old dump thread' is present
#  6. Cleanup
#
