## Test Case 1: Verify naming of foreground system threads.
##
## Foreground system threads should be named 'system user' except for 
## singleton threads such as 'event_scheduler'.

## Reference: Bug#36895513 "Wrong result in P_S.processlist on replica node"
## NOTE: Results must be manually verified.
